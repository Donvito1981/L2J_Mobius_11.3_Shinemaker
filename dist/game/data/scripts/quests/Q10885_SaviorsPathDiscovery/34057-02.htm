I see you are ready. Now I'm going to tell you what Leona has told me.<br>
In the last combat with Etis van Etina, Leona was badly wounded, so she had to train to recover her strength. Unfortunately, she had no time to complete the trainings because she received a message. It said about a dungeon of Atelia Fortress. Something connected to Etis van Etina was found there. That place was very odd and was called <font color="LEVEL">Atelia Refinery</font>.<br>
Leona wanted to meet you personally, but there was an urgent business, so she asked me to see you and explain the situation. My mission is connected with that place.<br>
