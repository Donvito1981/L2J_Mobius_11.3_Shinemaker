Ok, good...<br>
There can be up to 3 Sacred Fires lit at the same time.<br>
To check the status of the Sacred Fire, press the flame icon in the upper part of the Fire category in the ability enhancement UI.<br>
If the summoned Sacred Fire has been extinguished, you may summon a new one.<br><br>
Summoned Sacred Fire will disappear if it's successfully protected, destroyed, stolen or if the character that summoned it leaves the world of Conquest.<br>
If your inventory is more than 90% full, you will not be able to receive the reward and your Sacred Fire will be extinguished.<br><br>
Sacred Fire summoned by characters from other servers or through different means can be stolen.<br>
Each attempt costs 900 Conquest points and 400,000 SP.<br>
The price is paid even if the attempt ends in a failure.<br><br>
Are you ready to hear the rewards part?<br>
