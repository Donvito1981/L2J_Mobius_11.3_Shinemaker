Sacred Fire can only be summoned in the common area of the Fire Source in Conquest's Fire Area (after entering the area your character will turn into a rabbit).<br>
To extinguish a Sacred Fire that has been lit by a another player, you need to either steal it or destroy it.<br>
If a Sacred Fire hasn't been extinguished for 25 minutes, the character that has summoned it will receive Divine Fire with 100% chance.<br>
To protect the Sacred Fire for 25 minutes, you should use Flame Essence and Flame Guardian that are sold in the special Conquest store.<br>
Flame Essence increases the Sacred Fire's HP while Flame Guardian prevents other players from stealing your Sacred Fire for 25 minutes.<br><br>
Did you understood what I've told you until now?<br>
